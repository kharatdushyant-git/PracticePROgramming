Assignment 19

Q5) Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it.
Python application which contains one list of numbers. List contains
the numbers which are accepted from user. Filter should filter out
all prime numbers. Map function will multiply each number by 2.
Reduce will return Maximum number from that numbers.

Input List = [2, 70, 11, 10, 17, 23, 31, 77]

List after filter = [2, 11, 17, 23, 31]
List after map = [4, 22, 34, 46, 62]

Output of reduce = 62
