Assignment 19

Q4) Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it.
Python application which contains one list of numbers. List contains
the numbers which are accepted from user. Filter should filter out
all such numbers which are even. Map function will calculate its
square. Reduce will return addition of all that numbers.

Input List = [5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 8, 10]

List after filter = [2, 4, 4, 2, 8, 10]
List after map = [4, 16, 16, 4, 64, 100]

Output of reduce = 204

from functools import reduce

FilterX = lambda No : (No % 2 == 0)
MapX = lambda No : No * No
ReduceX = lambda A, B : A + B

    MData = list(map(MapX, FData))
